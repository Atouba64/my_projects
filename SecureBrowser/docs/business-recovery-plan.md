+# Business Recovery Plan
+
+In the event of a failed deployment or security incident, follow these steps:
+
+1. **Restore Browser Defaults**
+   - Uninstall the secure browser using standard Windows uninstall methods.
+   - Remove residual registry keys under `HKLM:\Software\SecureBrowser`.
+2. **Redeploy**
+   - Run `python Deploy-SecureBrowser.py` to reinstall and reapply policies.
+3. **Backup and Logs**
+   - Logs are stored in `%ProgramData%\SecureBrowser\Logs`. Back up these logs to assist in troubleshooting.
+
+Document any deviations and report them to the security team for review.
